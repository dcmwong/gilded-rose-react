# Gilded Rose React

Gilded Rose is a refactoring kata.  It demonstrates how to deal with legacy code ie. code with no tests and difficult to maintain.

I've included the golden master test but haven't included the snapshot so running `yarn test` for the first time will generate the snapshot.

# Up and running

```
 yarn
 yarn test
```

Run `yarn start` to see the output in the browser.
